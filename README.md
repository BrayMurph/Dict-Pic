# Dict. Pic.

## Description

This webpage is an online dictionary application that defines a word the user wants to search for. The webpage also provides animated pictures about the selected word. This webpage gives users a fun and unique experience searching different vocabulary paired with visual representation. This webpage can help people learn new words, strengthen their vocabulary, have visual inspiration, or get a good laugh. It can be used as a more engaging way to learn about words rather than the traditional search or dictionary uses. Our group learned how to use new APIs and implement them properly. We learned the importance of documentation and how it can help us work through problems throughout our process. We learned how to work in a group to successfully deploy a webpage.
